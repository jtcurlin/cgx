## 3D OpenGL Rendering Engine
![Demo_030124](./data/041524_demo.png)
 
#### This project is intended to be a multi-dimensional personal learning tool prompted by my perceived lack of experience/understanding of how to design a high-complexity software system -- experience which the fundamentals-oriented curriculum of a CS degree may not provide. 
#### My focus in developing this engine extends far beyond basic graphics programming -- this genre was selected in the hopes of building experience & deep understanding in the following areas:
* Modern C++, Build Systems, Debugging, and Cross-Platform Development
* Memory Management, Cache Behavior, & Data-Oriented Design
* OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Composition, General Class Design)
* Graphics Programming, GPU Architecture, Linear Algebra, and Advanced Geometry
* ...

#### Features _(under constant revision)_

* OpenGL core renderer supporting full 3D, textures & materials, basic phong lighting, and more
* GLFW-based window and input handling 
* Basic event system providing easy observer / listener registration and hashed string-defined events & parameters
* Data-oriented Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture providing extensiblity and cache optimization  
* Intuitive scene and resource systems built on inheritance-based 'item' hierarchy to permit easy GUI integration
* ...
